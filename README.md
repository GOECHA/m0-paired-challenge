# Mod 0 Paired Challenge

This challenge should be completed collaboratively with a partner. One repo should be submitted per pair. 

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository.

## Directions

Work through the following steps. **As you see fit, make commits.**

- Make a JavaScript or Ruby file (based on your program) inside of the `challenge` directory
- In the `challenge/index.md` file, create a list of 5 book titles. Start the file with a header.
- In the JavaScript or Ruby file, declare 6 variables - using a combination of Strings, Numbers/Integers, and Booleans. The data should all be about books or libraries
- In the same JavaScript or Ruby file, declare 1 variable that stores an Array of Strings. The data should be about books or libraries
- In the same JavaScript or Ruby file, write a comment on line 1 explaining the name you chose for this file
- Annotate 4 of the lines in the JavaScript or Ruby file
- In the `challenge/index.md` file, explain your workflow for this challenge - Who drove? Who Navigated? What parts, if any, did you get stuck on, or have questions, have to look something up, or maybe even disagree? 
- Push your work up to your repository

## Submission

The URL to your repository is what you will submit; have that page up and/or get the link copied to your clipboard.
